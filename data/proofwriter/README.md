## Please download the ProofWriter dataset and put it here

The download link is [https://aristo-data-public.s3.amazonaws.com/proofwriter/proofwriter-dataset-V2020.12.3.zip](https://aristo-data-public.s3.amazonaws.com/proofwriter/proofwriter-dataset-V2020.12.3.zip). 

Current folder should contain **CWA** and **OWA** two sub-folders. The code would clean the data and put the cleaned version in **CWA**.
